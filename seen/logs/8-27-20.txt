I think in some sort of way THE ZOO is me. Like a piece of my mind that could be immortalized forever, which is kinda scary if you think about it. Like what if someday someone comes and uses these logs or poems to like make an artificial intelegence. In a weird way it would be me right? Or like sorta me, or maybe like they would think it was me but in like reality it wasn't or whatever. CONCLUSION: IDK
