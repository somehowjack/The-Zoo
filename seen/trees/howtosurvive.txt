HOW TO SURVIVE

how do you survive 
the mouth of a volcano
where magma bubbles
and often explodes
and where the books make towers to the sky
and the windows are barred

there are a few simple rules
you need to follow
to survive this place
and leave alive

you must stand on the tips of your toes 
so your eyes meet the bottoms of their nose
and always act bigger than you are
so the harder it seems to topple you over
and when you do lay down your guard
make sure no ones awake
no one to see you
to see your hands quake

and never show them what your reading
because they'll latch on and rip it apart
like they've done before
never show them your bothered by their word
and when they do pretend like it doesn't hurt
pretend they don't dig under your skin
and make your bones feel wrong
like they're melting

always say your tired
so you don't ever show emotion
and just wade throught the commotion
and hope it's over soon
and try and not look them in the eyes
so they dont see through into your mind
but when you look away don't look too hard
they'll see your seeing through things
and think theres something going on

don't let them think something wrong
just laugh throught the pain
and when you can't laugh
go to the bathroom
and scratch your leg
but don't ever let them see it
that river of red

and when you can't smile
chew on ice
to make you mouth numb
to lessen the time you can talk
and make it look like you're busy

and when you're busy
don't make a blank face
yawn, blink, mumble
fill up that slate

you just need to make it
you don't have too much longer
just follow these rules and
and i promise it will all be over
