HOW TO SURVIVE

a quick guide
on how to survive
how to leave this forest
how to make it out alive

you must stand on the tips of your toes 
so your eyes meet the bottoms of their nose
and always act bigger than you are
so the harder it seems to topple you over
and when you do lay down your guard
make sure no ones awake
no one to see you
to see your hands shake

and never show them what your reading
because they'll latch on and rip it apart
like they've done before
never show them your bothered by their words
and when they do pretend like it doesn't hurt
pretend they don't dig under your skin
and make your bones feel wrong
like they're melting

always say you're tired
so you don't ever show emotion
and just wade throught the commotion
and hope it's over soon
and try and not look them in the eyes
so they dont see through into your mind
but when you look away don't look too hard
they'll see your seeing through things
and think theres something going on

don't let them think something wrong
just laugh through the pain
and when you can't laugh
go to the bathroom
and scratch your leg
but don't ever let them see it
that river of red

and when you can't smile
chew on ice
to make you mouth numb
to lessen the time you can talk
and make it look like you're busy

and when you're busy
don't make a blank face
yawn, blink, mumble
fill up that slate
and when you need to scream
find a pillow at night
the fluffier the better
and muffle the noise
so it's not defening

and don't look for a safespace
you will never find one
turn your body into a sanctury
and hide in it
but never hide yourself fully
always keep your head out
and scan their faces
looking where their eyes do

when you're alone
looking through the bars
try not to look too hard
you might start crying
and if you feel like you need to cry
hold it in your eyes
never let them see the rain

i'm sorry there are so many rules
they're really just there to protect you
because you just need to make it
you don't have too much longer
just follow these rules and
and i promise it will all be over
