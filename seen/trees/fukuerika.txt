FUK U ERIKA

fuk u erika

thats what it read
a carving in a tree 
stuck between the living sap
and the dying bark

it was carved in so deep
the lines so perfect
like you waited for the tree to bleed
and burned away what came out

and i wondered what erika did
why you spent all that time
why you needed her name out
why you continued to climb

were you like me?
did you find solace in the trees?
where the sun can only find it's way through the leaves
and where the branches reach out and scrape the sky
and lift you away from all your strife

and how many times did you come up here
before it stopped hurting
or did you ever leave
did you watch the leaves and understand
how no one looks above
and how the crows would find you
before anyone else

and i wondered if in between carving
when you'd put your back to your work
if you drempt about your wake
or if your parents worried when you were away
or if you imagined that
on the backs of birds
could hold your problems
glued to their feathers

and i knew you loved coming here
but couldn't understand how
no one could see in
but you could see out

i imagined if you would see
if you fell asleep and tumbled
from your longs hours of labor
how the branches could catch you
or maybe you thought
that from your days of carving
the tree would understand
and move it's arms aside

i want to think you wanted me to see it
like you left it here for me
because it all seems too uncanny
this message under the canopy

and i hope i find you someday
i hope i'm not too late
i hope that i'll understand your pain
and how it was too much for just one to handle
and for the world to bare

in the meantime
i cant help but stare
resting on the same branch as you
lost in the perfect lines
which you spent so long perfecting

fuk u erika

and when i look away
taking a break from your memory
through the leaves i see
that beautiful view from the canopy
