FUK U ERIKA

fuk u erika
is what it read
a carving in a tree 
stuck between the living sap
and the dying bark

it was carved in so deep
the lines so perfect
like you waited for the tree to bleed
and burned away what came out

and i wondered what erika did
why you spent all that time
why you needed her name out
why you continued to climb

were you like me?
did you find solace in the trees?
where the sun can only find it's way through the leaves
and where the branches reach out and scrape the sky
and lift you away from all your strife

how many times did you come up here
before it stopped hurting
or did you ever leave
did you watch the leaves and understand
how no one looks above
and how the crows would find you
before anyone else

and i wondered in between carving
when you'd put your back to your work
if you drempt about your wake


did you want me to see it
did you leave it here for me
because it all seems too uncanny
this message under the canopy

i hope i find you someday
i hope i'm not too late
i hope i'll know who erika was
and why you had so much hate

because the lines were so perfect
and the sap was burned away
and the tree was dying
