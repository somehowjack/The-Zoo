GRAY

yesterday
the dust settled 
as you drove away
nothing changed
you were so happy
because you saw me and waved
but i couldn't see you
and you said that's ok

and it made me feel so empty
like there's nothing left inside of me
like you took it all with you

but you brought me a gift
too big to ever use
and it cut me as i grabbed it
and spilled blood all over

and i rememeber on that moment
after you drove away
how the orange from the lights
turned a dull shade of gray
and the blood on the gift and the floor
lost all color
how my hand felt like static
and no longer hurt
a rock formed in my stomack
created discomfort
where there used to be sadness

and i try and feel something
try to have fun and talk to you
try to act like it will be different
but everthing i've written became true
like i've manifested my own suffering
my own emptyness

and i want to feel sorrow
because i was so painfully right
but i cant help but feel complacent
although i know nothing will change
it doesn't make me sad
but i'm not happy either

i want to know why i can't feel
why i can't feel pain
what i did to deserve this
why everything's so gray
