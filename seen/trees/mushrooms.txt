MUSHROOMS

i wish i could have roots these deep
like the ones of mushrooms
that connects them all together
tells each other the time and the weather
who leaves and enters

i can feel thier influence
their roots beneath me
wiggling
ecstatic that i'm trodding their ground

but it feels so fake
like only one cap likes me 
and the others are just pretending
because they all need to agree
to keep connected
and without the roots they'd be nothing
