EVERYTHING

the earth and the sky
the blue and the gray
and the heart inside
are all everything 

we are the stars
and the children of the universe
and the proud mistakes of eons
as wise as the trees around

and the stars will burn us 
i know they will
and we will be erased forever
as the proud mistakes we are
