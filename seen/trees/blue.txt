BLUE
*unfinished*

lying on the green
starting up at the blue
looking at it's vastness
and the way it formed a gradient with itself

and i wonder if i evaporated
if i'd end up there
a part of it's vastness
and if i'd become
the waters the birds swim through

the green was so soft
i thought maybe if i laid down
for long enough
if i would sink into it
six feet under in a blanket of comfort

and though i couldn't look directly at it
i could feel the white in the blue
