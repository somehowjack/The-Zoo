BLUE

lying on the green
staring up at the blue
looking at it's vastness
and the way it formed a gradient with itself

and i wonder if i evaporated
if i'd end up there
a part of it's vastness
and if i'd become
the waters the birds swim through

the green is so soft
i thought maybe if i lay down
for long enough
i would sink into it
six feet under in a blanket of comfort

and though i cant look directly at it
i can feel the white in the blue
and how it was there when i was born
and would be there when i die too

the universe placed me here
in this spot
where the green and the blue and the white
all intersect

and i feel so special
to be a part of this time
this unique picture i'll carry with me 
before the white expands and drowns out the blue
and when the green turns to orange
and then to dust

and i don't want to leave this beauty
i wish i could stay here forever
stop time for a little and keep
staring at that flying ocean

but even if time stops
and the green doesn't blow in the wind
i know it will grow over me
and cover my eyes

but i think i could still see the blue
if i squinted hard enough through
the cracks
