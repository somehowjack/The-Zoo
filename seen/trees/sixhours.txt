SIX HOURS

it was seven in the morning
but i felt six hours too late
like the sky should be black
and i should have been awake
i said what i could
but i didn't think you'd see it
because i though that you'd done it
and i was six hours too late

i saw myself in your body
in that final picture you sent
where you said you wanted to die
and i tried to save you
but you weren't there to see
because i was six hours too late
and you already left me

and i wondered if stayed awake
if things would change
if i had made plans that night
and caught you before you tried
if you would be alive
but i was six hours too late
and i couldn't stop your fate

and i wonder why no one else helped you
but it wasn't their place
you were scraping the bottom of the barrel
and was six hours too late

i've had bags under my eyes ever since
because i don't want to wake 
and ever be six hours too late
and besides, i can't sleep anyways
because whenever i feel that scar on my arm
i'm reminded of waking up
feeling that pain

and even though they say it's not my fault
that i couldn't have done anything
i always feel like i'm six hours too late
and i hope that when i die
no one feels the same
