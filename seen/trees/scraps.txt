where did my body lay last night
because my mind walked away from it
and i didn't glance before i left

where was i
who was i
my mind or my body
what was i looking for
who did i talk to
where did i go
why can't i remember anything

where am i?
where did i leave my body?
where did i go?
why can't i feel anything?

did i die?
is this limbo?
stuck between the earth and the sky
in where the sun can lift me up
and throw me arrai


and i don't want to leave this beauty
i wish i could stay here forever
stop time for a little and keep
staring at that flying ocean

but even if time stops
and the green doesn't blow in the wind
i know it will grow over me
and cover my eyes

but i think i could still see the blue
while covered by the green
if i squinted hard enough through
the cracks


but i feel more like a weed
like i'd choke out the other plants
and drain the forest of life
if i ever spread my seeds
