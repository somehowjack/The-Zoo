OCTOPUS

with you the sky has always been so gray
like i've been removed from reality
where the air tastes like iron 
and the ground is wet with rain
where the puddles pool up in the lowest of the road
and your socks get wet
when you want to go home

but i cant go yet
when i'm under your contol
because your tenticles pull me in
pulling tighter and tighter
sucking my life
lifting me higher

and they wrap around me
more and more as time passes
ripping the air from my lungs
and when i try and breathe
all i taste is iron

and your reach extends
past just that road
or wherever you go
because sometimes when i'm alone
i'll check my phone
and watch as the sky turns gray

and i'll feel your arms around me
holding me back
removing me from reality
and i cant help but choke
as your grasp gets tighter
as the air turns to iron
