POLAR BEAR

do you remember that night?
the one where you slept over
i knew i couldn't so i came early
i took my shoes off to go inside
you did the same not much later
most of that night was uneventful

but i do rememeber you were bragging
boasting i think
trying to get a laugh
but i could see there was more
behind your words than you let on
and i saw the pain in you eyes
your lonely days on the ice
where the sun wouldn't shine

and i had seen that place
had been there before
where the storms could get so thick
that you couldn't see the door
i think i said something 
it was under my breath
so i said it louder
and still nobody heard

so i left 
slipped out the door
i was on the porch
sitting down on the couch
where the trees started to swing
from side to side
their leaves weeping
as they fell down to the ground

and as the trees weeped
i couldn't really think 
my mind was the snowstorm
and i was stuck inr the middle of it

you found me later
you asked me what was wrong
said i looked like i was gonna cry
but it was hard to hear you over the whipping winds
and i knew it was true

you told me to come with
to trudge with you in the snow
so i followed you out
you said you'd cheer me up
but i wasn't really there
my mind was in a snowstorm
and i left my shoes on the stairs

and i was still in that snowstorm
when i slipped away
i lost you in the moment
i lost you in the fray
but i wasn't really looking
i was staring at the snow
watching it rise
watching it grow

and in the distance i saw the trees swaying
swaying from the storm
but the couch was not there
so wasn't the porch
so i went to find them
leaving the trees
leaving them to weep

i must have stepped on something
because the snow behind me 
was starting to run red
my foot was mostly numb
probably from the cold
but i found a bastion of hope
a tree not like the rest

the tree wasn't weeping
it wasn't swaying or shaking
it was perfectly still
so i climbed up
while my foot continued to bleed

i found a branch
high up so i could see
through the thick storm
but i only looked down
i wondered if i jumped
like i had before
if the snow would break my fall

and i just sat there debating it
and as i sat the winds threw snow all around
and the snow continued to rise for the ground
the sound was so loud
of the wind whipping by
it made it hard to think
of anything other than the tree

and through the whipping wind i wondered
what if this tree wasn't so strong?
if it started weeping
would i be thrown?
where would i land?
would the snow catch me?
who would miss me?
when would they find me?
would they search through the storm?
or would they wait for it to be sunny

as i sat i tried to think of answers
but couldn't
my mind was a snowstorm
and what i was looking for was far away
obstructed by the snow
so i stopped looking
and looked down
my blood had dripped onto the snow at the base of the tree
and it got so large i finally saw
the trail of red i had left behind in the snow

so i left the tree and followed the red
and for a moment i looked back
and through the thick storm
i saw the tree begin to shake
to weep
and i turned around and went back to you
