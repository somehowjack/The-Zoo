POLAR BEAR

do you remember that night?
the one where you slept over
i knew i couldn't so i came early
i took my shoes off to go inside
you did the same not much later
most of that night was uneventful

but i do rememeber you were bragging
boasting i think
trying to get a laugh
but i could see there was more
behind your words than you let on
and i saw the pain in you eyes
your lonely days on the ice
where the sun wouldn't shine

and i had seen that place
had been there before
where the storms could get so thick
that you couldn't see the door
i think i said something 
it was under my breath
so i said it louder
and still nobody heard

so i left 
slipped out the door
i was on the porch
sitting down on the couch
where the trees started to swing
from side to side
their leaves weaping
as they fell down the the ground

and as the trees weaped
i couldn't really think 
my mind was the snowstorm
when you found me so late

you asked me what was wrong
said i looked like i was gonna cry
i knew it was true
but i acted otherwise

so i followed you out
said you'd cheer me up
but i wasn't really there
because i was still in my socks

i was in a snowstorm
when i slipped away
i lost you in the moment
i lost you in the fray
but i wasn't really looking
i was staring at the snow
watching it rise
watching it grow

and in the distance i saw the trees swaying
swaying from the storm
but the couch was not there
so wasn't the porch
so i went to find them
leaving the trees
leving them to weep

i must have stepped on something
because the snow behind me 
was starting to run red
my foot was mostly numb
probably from the cold
but i found a bastion of hope
a tree not like the rest

the tree wasn't weeping
it wasn't swaying or shaking
it was perfectly still
so up i climbed
while my foot continued to bleed

i found a branch
high up so i could see
through the thick storm
but i only looked down
i wondereed if i jumped
if the snow would break my fall

and i just sat there debating it
and as i sat 
blood dripped onto the snow
and when it got so large i finally saw
the trail of red i had left
and i followed it back
