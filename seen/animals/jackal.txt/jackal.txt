JACKAL

you always wished i could stay
said you'd always miss me
whenever i'm not around
but you weren't really thinking

i'm sure i came up in passing
like a memory fading
between the sun and the moon spinning
stuck between sunset and sunrise
where the stars streak across the sky 
and torchbugs become fire

and it's beautiful
(at least that's what i hear)
and you go back to join the parade
dancing under the purple, orange, and blue
where you can be you

i'm sure i'll see it one day
when the sky is everthing at once 
and where it feels like time stops
where you can dance forever
where you make your own moves
and dance to your own tune
