PANIC

what have you done?
what did you do to me?
why can't i think?
why can't i breathe?

stop squeezing my lungs
slow down my heart beat
if you're doing this 
please, go easy

don't overthink?
don't think at all?
what do you mean?
is that even possible?

jump off a tree?
cut out your eyes?
what are you saying?
what are these lies?

please get out!
get out of my head!
stop it, stop!
why do you wish me dead?!

ok ok, i'll do it
i'll do it for you
i'll carve out my eyes
i'll carve my brain too

just please stop yelling
stop saying my name
stop bouncing inside me
stop rotting my brain

i'll know my friends will miss me
i know that you will too
but the choking won't ever stop
until the knife goes through

VULTURE

at least you tried
to learn everything about their mind
but you weren't there
and only learned your not the same kind

because you didn't try hard enough
i guess you didn't want to
because you'd never ask to see them
because you wouldn't know what to do

because you'd always leave
for no reason at all
because you gave excuses
because you'd never call

because they never knew you
i didn't really either
because you never told them
because you were a liar

because you'd always show up
when it never really mattered
because you'd stay quiet
because you'd shattered

because you had adapted
adding little at best
because you had nothing
because you'd never dressed 

because you are a vulture
they sky was your mind
because you barely tried
because you're not the same kind
