VULTURE

at least you tried
to learn everything about their mind
but you weren't there
and only learned your not the same kind

because you didn't try hard enough
i guess you didn't want to
because you'd never ask to see them
because you wouldn't know what to do

because you'd always leave
for no reason at all
because you gave excuses
because you'd never call

because they never knew you
i didn't really either
because you never told them
because you were a liar

because you'd always show up
when it never really mattered
because you'd stay quiet
because you'd shattered

because you had adapted
adding little at best
because you had nothing
because you'd never dressed 

because you are a vulture
they sky was your mind
because you barely tried
because you're not the same kind
