PANIC

what have you done?
what did you do to me?
why can't i think?
why can't i breathe?

stop squeezing my lungs
slow down my heart beat
if you're doing this 
please, go easy

don't overthink?
don't think at all?
what do you mean?
is that even possible?

jump off a tree?
cut out your eyes?
what are you saying?
what are these lies?

please get out!
get out of my head!
stop it, stop!
why do you wish me dead?!

ok ok, i'll do it
i'll do it for you
i'll carve out my eyes
i'll carve my brain too

just please stop yelling
stop saying my name
stop bouncing inside me
stop rotting my brain

i'll know my friends will miss me
i know that you will too
but the choking won't ever stop
until the knife goes through
