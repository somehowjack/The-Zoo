where oh where do the days go?
to empty streets
or to broken roads

you said magic was the answer
said we had no future

it split us apart

and everyday since has been a headache

you had left
before i did too
you went to 

you held that flame in your mouth
the same one that burned me
not just me but everyone
but everyone 

i think the fire broke something
something in my head
because ever since that night
i've felt charred
like a husk of who you last saw
sitting on that porch
