DRAGON

do you remember that night
the night i didn't have a cage
the night i said i could stay
when i had a headache
because i remember you left
left with the parade
left me outside

i watched you walk away
you went to the field
the grass in the night:
a sea of black for you to stumble through

before you went
you asked if i was ok
i told you i had a headache
i told you to have fun 
to not worry about me

you told me to just sit there on the porch
to wait for all of this to be over
but i didn't
i watched until you dissapead into that sea
thats when i escaped

i headed for the hills
not too far away
where the grass could become all encompassing
where i could get lost in it
in it's endless void
to focus on something
to drown out the pain

because the headache was throbbing
arming the voices
to attack at my heart
to rip me apart

i tried to drown out the voices
to blur them into the black
but that's when it happend
when the ember was born

you lit it with your fire
the fire from your mouth
which quickly enveloped you
and everyone else
the fire began pulsing
pulsing with the pain
and through it the voices died

but the sea was black with oil
oil to burn
which burned and burned
and didn't stop
i didn't run
i sat there
i stared
entranced by the fire
i imagined being consumed
in it's warm reasuring brace

the headache became splitting
but i could barely notice
all it did was make the fire dance faster
more spiradically
in every direction
but it wouldn't come closer
it was only feet away
and it beckoned for me
but i couldn't bring it to myself to stand
and walk in

i think i was still afraid
to see what was in that inferno
but it was so close
and i could feel it's warmth
how surrounded me like a hug
and hurt like cold stinging air

the fire died down
broke me from my trance
i could feel my headache again
and i looked back and saw the ember in that field
waxing and waning
breathing, fading
it was no longer warm
and the cold midnight breeze returned to me
as i returned to your porch

i think even though i don't have the mark 
that fire still burned me
because you found me on that porch charred
like i had never left
but something left me
and i saw as you walked in
that ember in your eye
which never left you
and quickly spread to the others

and now i only see your fire
wherever you go
like a blazing trail of chaos
that seprates us both

i wonder if you ever saw that inferno too
if you meant for it to burn me or you
and if the fire for you was so great
or if you ever saw it dance with the parade
