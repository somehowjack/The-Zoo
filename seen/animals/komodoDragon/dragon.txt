DRAGON

do you remember that night
the night i didn't have a cage
the night i said i could stay
when i had a headache
because i remember you left
left with the parade
left me outside

i watched you walk away
with people behind you
you went to the field
the grass in the night:
a sea of black for you to stumble through

before you went
you asked if i was ok
i told you i had a headache
i told you to have fun 
to not worry about me

you told me to just sit there on the porch
to wait for all of this to be over
but i didn't
i watched until you dissapead into that sea
thats when i left

i headed for the hills
not too far away
where the grass could become all encompassing
where i could get lost in it
in it's endless void
to focus on something
to drown out the pain

because the headache was throbbing
arming the voices
to attack at my heart
to rip me apart

i tried to drown out the voices
to blur them into the black
but that's when it happend
when the ember was born

you lit it with your fire
the fire from your mouth
which quickly enveloped you
and everyone else
the fire began pulsing
pulsing with the pain
and through it the voices died

but the sea was black with oil
oil to burn
which burned and burned
and didn't stop
i didn't run
i sat there
entranced by the fire
i imagined being consumed
in it's warm reasuring brace

the headache became splitting
but i could barely notice
all it did was make the fire dance faster
more spiradically
in every direction
but it wouldn't come closer
and was only feet away
it beckoned for me
and i couldn't bring it to myself to stand
and walk in

i think i was still afraid
to see what was in that inferno
but it was so close
and i could feel it's warmth
it surrounded me like a hug
but it hurt like cold stinging air

the fire died down
broke me from my trance
i could feel my headache again
and i looked back and saw the ember in that field
waxing and waning
breathing, fading
it was no longer warm
and the cold midnight breeze returned to me
as i returned to your porch

i think the fire broke something
something in my head
because ever since that night
i've felt charred
like a husk of who you last saw
sitting on that porch

and i don't remember what i saw in that fire
or even if you saw it too
but ever since that fateful night
everyday has been a headache
