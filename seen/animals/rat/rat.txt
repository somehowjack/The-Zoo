i don't quite understand you
(not that i haven't tried)
it's not that i cant stand you
(trust me, my hands are tied)



i remember you were there
late at night
with the pond
with the hare

i remember you were watching the sand
while i was watching the water
and you were laughing
i was thinking
i dont think i was there
like really there
you were with the parade
and found me later that day
but i was listening to what you
