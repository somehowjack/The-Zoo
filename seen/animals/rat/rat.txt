RAT

i remember you were watching the sand
talking to the other animals
and while you were laughing
i sat and watched the hares

they stood very still
they were scattered about
so i stood still too
i thought maybe if i didn't move
that they would come close
close enough to where i could see them

but you were too loud
with you're pips and your squeaks
and the other animal's roared
and they hopped away into the night

i went to go find them
i don't rememebr what i said
it must have been a good excuse
because you didn't look for me
until i found the rabbits myself

i think they knew me
because i could hear their thoughts
which were mine in a way
but not exactly
they told me who i was
and who i could be
they couldn't see my future
but they saw something ahead of me

thats when you came
scurrying in the night
you slipped on by
i didn't see you sit next to me
i was lost in the rabbits

i remember how the saw the hares
i'll remember how you saw them in my eyes
when they werent really there
you saw them hopping about in my mind
where they could tell me all sorts of lies

you said it was nothing
you said to get over it
said everybody saw rabbits
said that it doesn't mean i should leave

i think you were right
that there were other hares too
ones i couldn't see or hear
but i didn't see you looking for them
so i couldn't help but always watch mine
with a strange fascination

and they'd always follow us
whenever you were around
but they'd never show up when i was alone
but they would get closer whenever you leave
so i'd always escape
like a leaf in the breeze

and when i was finally alone
i could go find the rabbits
i could sit very still
and they could get oh so close
close enough where i could hear what they were saying
to hear what they saw in me
and i could know who I am
and i would know who i could be

so it probably makes sense now
why i fell chasing that rabbit in the park
because they'd tell me who i was
which was well worth the scar
