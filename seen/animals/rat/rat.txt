RAT

i remember you were watching the sand
talking to the other animals
and while you were laughing
i sat and watched the hares

they stood very still
they were scattered about
so i stood still too
i thought maybe if i didn't move
that they would come close
close enough to where i could see them

but you were too loud
with you're pips and your squeaks
and the other animal's roared
the rabbits hopped away into the night

i went to go find them
i don't rememebr what i said
it must have been a good excuse
because you didn't look for me
until i found the rabbits myself

i think they knew me
because i could hear their thoughts
which were mine in a way
but not exactly
they told me who i was
and who i could be
they couldn't see my future
but they saw something ahead of me

thats when you came
scurrying in the night
you slipped on by
i didn't see you sit next to me
i was lost in my own mind

and you looked where the hares were
and you thought you knew what i saw
and you said it was nothing
you said get over it
you said everybody saw rabbits

in a sense you were right
there were other hares too
ones i couldn't seen or hear
but i couldn't help but always watch mine
because they'd always follow me
whenever you were around

they would get closer whenever you leave
so i'd always escape
like a leaf in the breeze

and when i was finally alone
i could go find the rabbits
i could sit very still
and they could get close
close enough to hear what they were saying
to hear what they saw
and i could know who I am
and i can know who i could be

it probably makes sense now
why i fell chasing that rabbit in the park
because they'd tell me who i was
which was worth all the scars
