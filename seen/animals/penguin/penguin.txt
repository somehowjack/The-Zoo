PENGUIN

you fade from my memory
into dreams
where you slide and waddle
in between set pieces
when the curtains draw back
and throw me away
you always are watching
always chanting from the parade
where you quickly get lost in obscurity
a penguin in the flock
because your words are muffled
by the ethereal veil that
lines every dream

and even outside of dreams
your words are still confusing
like you speak another language
or are from another planet
and that veil is still there
outside of the dreams
weather you see it or not
it blurs your image
and mutes every word
but it can't remove your presence

and your actions too
always spoke louder than words
because i couldn't hear what you said
but what you did hurt to hear
like chalk feels in the hands
or like a thousand voices in pain
each reaching out
screaming their name
and i thought maybe your voice could be in there
in that horrible choir

maybe that's why i never knew you
because i couldn't hear your voice
and anything you were saying
or maybe it was your actions
of always being absent
when you made the voices always scream
off from the horizon
