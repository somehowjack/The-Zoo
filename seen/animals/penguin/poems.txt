PENGUIN
*this one's really shit so...*

like rolling clouds
you move on by
not stopping to say your name
and like a cloud
i'll only see once
i know you just about the same

it's funny to think
that you could be a cloud
when you're obviously just a penguin
when i only see you once
outide of a crowd
never getting to find you ever again

i don't think it's your fault
if anything it's probably mine
i just wish i knew you better
so when you go back to join the flock
back to the tornado of voices
i could find you in that torrential weather
