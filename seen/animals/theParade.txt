i see the parade forming in my mind
drawing in animals far and wide
the mammals, the fish, the lizards, the birds
forming in a circle, a kind of herd

the birds fly high
watching from the sky
while the hyena prowls from afar
the otter's in the sea
listening carefullly
while the horse is nowhere to be seen

the ones in the center
