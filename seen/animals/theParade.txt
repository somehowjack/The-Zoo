THE PARADE

whenever i imagine you
i see you as a parade
chanting in a circle
dancing all the same
perfectly in unison

and as my eyes scan from face to face
i remember all the pain
i remember the fire
and how it stung like the breeze
and how the breeze only hurt
when i was bleeding from my feet

and how the rabbits would come
only when you were away
who told me you were wrong
while you told me to stay
and how the screams always sounded
coming from the horizon
where the sun could meet the earth
and paint the grass with oil

and how the oil and the rain
always smelled like iron
made molten by the fire
and how you'd always miss me
when i lost in a snowstorm
i how i could never see that sky
lost in my own mind

but i watch my body join you
walk away from me
and i don't know how to dance
how to chant
but it does anyway
imitating

and i'm bordering on delusion
as i watch myself dance
i cant move
or speak 
and i try to scream
and i remember everything again

aand i can't leave
i cant escape
i cant go away
i'm trapped

i'm not the same kind
i was never the same kind
i could never see that sky from the windows
i never left that snowstorm
i should have joined that fire
i wish the tree started weeping
i wish it threw me onto the snow
i wish i fell harder chasing rabbits
i wish you finish choking me 
i wish you'd stop screaming
i wish my ears would bleed

the parade is getting too fast now
i need to take control
i need to take a break
i'm sorry if i'm leaving
i've done it many times before
i'll come back someday
and hopefully next time 
i'll see your beauty
instead of the pain
