i can remember the time
i wanted to be the raft
upon which you float

but you are the sea
the waves
the ocean
the everything

i think in some strange way
your waves
could me mine 

i don't want to drown
i don't want to sink
i want to tread your waters
i want to be able to think

whenever, you're away,
there's always rain.
but that's not to say,
that your sky is anyless gray.

with my head in the clouds
and yours above the water
there is no possible way
we could see each other
