OTTER

i'm sorry truly sorry
that i dragged you down with me
to the lowly pits of my mind

because i know you really worry
i worry for you too
but it's not fair to assume that
it's ok

and you always say it's fine
that that's what friends are for
but if that's the case
than i've never had a friend before

again i'm really sorry
for dragging you down with me
i really am thankful for all you've done
but i wont bother you again
