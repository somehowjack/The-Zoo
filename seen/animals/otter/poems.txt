HARVEST MOON

you are the ocean
the waves you confide
a channel for emotion
that i wish i could bide

but the harvest moon's pulling
pulling at your core
pushing me away
pushing me to shore

i'm sorry if i'm leaving
it's really just the tide
because the harvest moon is pulling
and i can no longer bide

OTTER
