You are the only one in here that doesn't need a READme. You probably know me better than even I. I've told you pretty much everything of note about myself. You probably have enough to make like a blockbuster 5 star hollywood movie with highs and lows, comedy and genuine saddness. But where would you write yourself in? Who would you be in my story. To be honest, I don't know where I would put you. It's hard to sum up someone who is so everpresent (without it being weird). Anyways, I don't need to explain your liberties, you know who you are and you know you can ask me anything. :)
